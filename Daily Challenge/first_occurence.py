# Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
# The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
# Example 2:

# Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
# Output: -1
# Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
# haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
    pass


# SOLUTION

# Intuition
# If we can find the length of the needle then we can use that as the window size and use the sliding windows approach to solve this problem

# Approach
# This is a Python function that implements the "strstr" function, which searches for a substring within a larger string. The function takes two string arguments, haystack and needle, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the needle in the haystack, or -1 if the needle is not found.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

# The function starts by checking if needle is equal to haystack. If it is, then needle is a substring of haystack and its starting index is 0. In this case, the function returns 0.

# If needle is not equal to haystack, the function initializes two variables: i, which represents the starting index of a substring of haystack, and j, which represents the ending index of that substring. Initially, i is set to 0 and j is set to the length of needle.

# The function then enters a loop that continues until j is greater than the length of haystack. In each iteration of the loop, the function extracts a substring of haystack that starts at index i and ends at index j - 1. This substring is stored in a variable called currentNeedle.

# The function then compares currentNeedle with needle. If they are equal, it means that needle is a substring of haystack starting at index i. The function returns i.

# If currentNeedle is not equal to needle, the function increments i and j by 1 and continues with the next iteration of the loop.

# If the loop completes without finding a match for needle, the function returns -1.

# Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to search for substrings within a larger string in Python.

# Complexity
# Time complexity:
# O(mn)

# Space complexity:
# O(n)

# The time complexity of this function is O(mn), where m is the length of haystack and n is the length of needle. This is because in the worst case scenario, we need to compare every substring of haystack of length n with needle.

# The space complexity of this function is O(n), because we are using a slicing operation haystack[i:j] which return a copy of substring, Which can be of size n.

# Code
# class Solution:
#     def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
#         if needle == haystack:
#             return 0
#         i = 0
#         j = len(needle)
#         while j <= len(haystack):
#             currentNeedle = haystack[i:j]
#             if currentNeedle == needle:
#                 return i
#             i += 1
#             j += 1
#         return -1
