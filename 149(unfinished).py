# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.


# hint
# hashmap
# 1. for each pt determine if it lies on the longest slope
# 2. count all pts with same slope
# 3. update result with max
